# CS-341-Project

Proposal:

- Our idea for an app stems off the idea for a model train track designer app, where the user would be able to design their own track using a set of pieces they choose from. They can save and load their own designs, or load someone else’s design if they have the key for it. Track limits can be set for designs if someone wants to only use the pieces they have, and they can even take a picture of where they want to put a track to see how it’ll look! Building a track would allow a user to either drag and drop pieces that snap together, or they can draw a line from a previous segment and let the app decide what angle they were trying to use.
- This app would be most useful for model train hobbyists, as it lets them bring their track ideas to life, without spending so much time assembling and disassembling physical tracks if a design doesn’t work! It’s cool to be able to lay out your designs and know they’ll work without needing to assemble everything by hand first, and it’s essential for saving time on these projects!

We plan to communicate via Discord, and meet in-person after each class (Tuesday and Thursday, around 4:30 until whenever the meeting concludes).
